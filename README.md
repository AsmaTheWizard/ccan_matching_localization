# Scan Matching Localization

The project is part of Udacity Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree program [here](https://www.udacity.com/course/self-driving-car-engineer-nanodegree--nd0013)

The goal of the project is to use scan matching techniques to localize a vehicle in a 2D map. Scan matching is a technique used in robotics and autonomous vehicles to align the sensor data with a known map. In this project, I used the Udacity self-driving car simulator(their Carla simulator version) to collect lidar data and then use scan matching algorithms to determine the vehicle's position in the map.

For this project, I used NDT.

Note: if you want to run this project, you need Carla project and you need to run the script multiple times, with each run, the result will get better.
