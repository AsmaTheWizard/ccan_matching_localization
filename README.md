The project is part of Udacity Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree program [here](https://www.udacity.com/course/self-driving-car-engineer-nanodegree--nd0013)

For this project, I used NDT.

Note: if you want to run this project, you need Carla project and you need to run the script multiple times, with each run, the result will get better.
